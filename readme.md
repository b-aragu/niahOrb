## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Grok API Key** (you must have a valid Grok API key)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/niah-orb.git
   cd niah-orb
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Grok API key:

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key_here
```

4. Backend Setup:
   To handle the API requests, you need to run the backend server. This server provides the `/send_to_grok` endpoint that the frontend will use to send information to the **Grok API** for processing.

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
node src/Experience/server.js
```

This will start the backend server and provide the /send_to_grok API endpoint at http://localhost:3000/send_to_grok.

6. Frontend Setup:
   The frontend will send captured speech data to the backend API, process it through the Grok API, and provide spoken responses back to the user.

Start the frontend development server:

```
bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### API Communication Flow

1. The frontend captures the user's speech.
2. The captured speech is sent via a POST request to the backend at the `/send_to_grok` endpoint.
3. The backend sends the speech data to the Grok API for processing.
4. The Grok API processes the input and sends a response back.
5. The frontend receives the response and uses speech synthesis to talk back to the user.
